  """
  Computes the forward pass for an affine (fully-connected) layer.

  The input x has shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k) where x[i] is the ith input.
  We multiply this against a weight matrix of shape (D, M) where
  D = \prod_i d_i

  Inputs:
  x - Input data, of shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k)
  w - Weights, of shape (D, M)
  b - Biases, of shape (M,)
  
  Returns a tuple of:
